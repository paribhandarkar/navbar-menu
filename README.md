# Navbar Menu

This project is a responsive navbar menu with a hamburger icon that toggles the display of the menu on click. The menu is styled with CSS, and the JavaScript code uses the DOM API to select the hamburger icon and the menu, and adds an event listener to toggle the "show-menu" class on the menu when the hamburger icon is clicked. This allows the menu to be hidden on small screens and displayed on larger screens, improving the user experience on different devices. The project is easy to implement and customize for your own website.
